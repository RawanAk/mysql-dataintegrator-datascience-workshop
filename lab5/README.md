# Lab 5: Transform your Data into Insights

![Data Science](./images/ds_banner.jpg)

**Oracle Data Science**: Build high-quality models faster and easier. Automated machine learning capabilities rapidly examine the data and recommend the optimal data features and best algorithms. Additionally, automated machine learning tunes the model and explains the modelâ€™s results.

## Create Policies

Create Dynamic Group

`datascience`

`Data Science Dynamic Group`

`ALL { resource.type = 'datasciencenotebooksession' }`

Create Policies

In the root compartment

`datascience`

`Data Science to use network resources`

`allow service datascience to use virtual-network-family in tenancy`

`allow dynamic-group datascience to manage data-science-family in tenancy`

## Create a Data Science Project

Go to Menu > Data Science > Projects.

Click **Create Project**.

Set the name and description as follows:

> Name: `Nature`
> 
> Description: `Fish Survey notebook`

The next step is to create a Notebook, click **Create Notebook Session**.

Set the following values:

> Name: `Fish Survey`
> 
> Compute Instance Shape: `VM.Standard.E2.2`, but others will work as well.
> 
> Block Storage Size: `50`
> 
> VCN: `nature`
> 
> Subnet: `Private Subnet-nature`

Click **Create**.

The status icon will change from Creating to Active:

![Creating](./images/datascience-creating.png)

![Active](./images/datascience-active.png)

When the Notebook is active, click **Open**.

## Install libraries

Click **Terminal**.

And type the following command:

`pip install mysql-connector-python pandas seaborn`

Wait for the installation to complete.

## Create Jupyter Notebook environment

Download the Notebook [here](files/FishSurvey.ipynb).

Click **Upload files** and select `FishSurvey.ipynb` from your disk.

Double click on **FishSurvey.ipynb** on the left list of files.

Make sure you modify `PRIVATE_IP` on the following code in the Notebook with the Private IP from your MySQL Database System.

```
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="PRIVATE_IP",
  user="root",
  passwd="R2d2&C3po!",
  database="nature"
)
```

Run the Notebook cell by cell, clicking the **play** icon over and over until you reach the end.

## Congratulations! Well done!
